              <h2>What is Codecraftor?</h2>
              <p>
                Codecraftor is a visual web builder platform with a component
                marketplace and the ability to easily download and deploy your
                website. Codecraftor aims to simplify web development by
                composing fully functional websites visually with simple and
                complex reusable components. What this means is that Codecraftor
                is a web site creation tool in between WYSIWYG and coding from
                scratch.
              </p>

            <div className="index-main-content-section">
              <h2>Why Codecraftor?</h2>
              <p>
                Unlike Wix, Squarespace and other big players, there are no
                lock-ins with Codecraftor. You can download your website,
                customize and deploy it wherever you want. On top of that, you
                get to use community-built components in your apps which
                developers can publish on the platform.

                How is it different from other web site builders out there?
              </h2>
              <p>
                There isn't really a good middle-ground tool between visual
                design and code. Codecraftor aims to become that tool. With
                Codecraftor, users will not only be able to visually compose
                their site, but also pick their web framework of choice (React,
                Angular, etc), choose a UI toolkit, and eventually pushed the
                site to a domain or even download the complete source code. The
                idea is that all this should be able to be done via an easy
                conversational user interface.

              <p>
                Codecraftor is still a work in progress. I tried to build a very
                basic prototype to convey the idea. Bear in mind that for
                Codecraftor to really be successful, this prototype will need
                evolve greatly. But stay tuned as I am working hard on it and
                listening to all the feedback I'm getting from other Pioneer
